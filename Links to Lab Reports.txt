Welcome to my Neural Engineering Portfolio. This contains a lab reports and projects from BIOMEDE 517 - Neural Engineering at the University of Michigan. I learned a great deal about electrode design for neural tissue stimulation and recording, neural anatomy and simulating various neural models with COMSOL and NEURON, gathering, processing, and analyzing data such as EEG and ECoG with continuous decoders such as Kalman Filters, and making predictions over neural data with machine learning and deep learning techniques.

My Final Project consisted of a Recurrent Neural Network which I wrote using TensorFlow that was able to detect seizures in EEG time series data.
